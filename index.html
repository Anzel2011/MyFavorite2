      I really like reading manga. It is basically an anime in a book, and before the anime is created the manga is there first. I have something to read for once. I dont have many intrest in other books so I read manga. Manga is really cool. There are horror, romance, action, adventure, more to count. We have My Hero Academia, Black Clover, Naruto, etc.
